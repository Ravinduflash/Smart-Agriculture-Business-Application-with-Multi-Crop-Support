# Smart Agriculture Business Application - Netlify Deployment

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### ✅ Completed Setup
- [x] Project built successfully
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] Vite configuration optimized for production
- [x] Code splitting implemented to reduce bundle size
- [x] Netlify configuration file (netlify.toml) created
- [x] SPA redirects configured
- [x] Environment variables prepared

### 🚀 Deployment Steps

#### 1. Environment Variables Setup in Netlify
Before deploying, you MUST set up the environment variable in Netlify:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add the following environment variable:
   - **Variable name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `AIzaSyBU_JLFJlfVGcqgg90N-4v1ha59Gqaeyto`

#### 2. Deploy to Netlify

**Option A: Drag & Drop Deployment**
1. Build the project locally: `npm run build`
2. Upload the entire `dist` folder to Netlify's deploy interface
3. Your site will be live immediately

**Option B: Git Integration (Recommended)**
1. Initialize a Git repository in this folder
2. Push to GitHub/GitLab
3. Connect the repository to Netlify
4. Netlify will automatically build and deploy

#### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)
- Configure your custom domain in Netlify's domain settings
- Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)

### 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

```
dist/                          # Build output directory
├── index.html                 # Main HTML file
├── assets/                    # Optimized JS/CSS files
└── locales/                   # Translation files

Configuration Files:
├── netlify.toml              # Netlify build configuration
├── _redirects               # SPA routing redirects
├── package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
└── vite.config.ts           # Build optimization
```

### 🔧 Build Optimization Features
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries separated for better caching
- **Chunk Size Optimization**: Large dependencies split into manageable chunks
- **Asset Optimization**: Static assets properly handled
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key handling

### 🌐 Post-Deployment
After deployment, your Smart Agriculture dashboard will be accessible with:
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Multi-language support (English, Sinhala, Tamil)
- Real-time IoT sensor data integration
- AI-powered crop management features
- Analytics and reporting capabilities

### ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **API Key Security**: The GEMINI_API_KEY is set as an environment variable and won't be exposed in the client code
2. **ThingSpeak Integration**: Ensure your ThingSpeak channels are properly configured
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Built with modern browser support
4. **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading with code splitting

### 🐛 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs for any errors
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure all API endpoints are accessible from the deployed domain
4. Check browser console for any runtime errors

Ready for deployment! 🚀
